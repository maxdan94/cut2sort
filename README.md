Computes graph cut recursively in order to obtain an ordering of the nodes

## To compile:

"make"

## To execute:

"./cut2order edgelist.txt order.txt [bisection]".

"edgelist.txt" should contain an undirected unweighted graph: one edge on each line (two unsigned long (nodes' ID)) separated by a space.

"order.txt": will contain the resulting order of the nodes: "oldID newID\n" on each line.

option "bisection": the  bisection algorithm to use, default is 1.
- 0: random bisection
- 1: greedy spasest cut
- 2: greedy densest cut
- 3: greedy max cut
